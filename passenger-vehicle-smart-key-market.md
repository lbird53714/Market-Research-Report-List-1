<p><strong>The Passenger Vehicle Smart Key Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OEM</li><li>Aftermarket</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The passenger vehicle smart key market comprises two main segments: OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Aftermarket. OEM smart keys are embedded in vehicles during the manufacturing process and come pre-installed by the vehicle manufacturer. These smart keys offer advanced features like keyless entry, push-button start, and remote vehicle control. On the other hand, aftermarket smart keys are purchased separately and can be retrofitted into vehicles that do not have smart key capabilities. Aftermarket smart keys provide similar functionalities to OEM keys, but are installed post-purchase by vehicle owners or third-party service providers.</p></p>
