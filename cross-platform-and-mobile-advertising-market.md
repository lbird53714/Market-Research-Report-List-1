<p><strong>Major Market Players</strong></p>
<p><p>Google, one of the leading players in the competitive cross-platform and mobile advertising market, has a rich past history. Founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google initially started as a search engine. However, it quickly expanded its offerings, including Google AdWords in 2000, which allowed businesses to advertise on its search platform. Over the years, Google has leveraged its advertising technology to dominate the online advertising space, making it one of the most successful companies in the industry.</p><p>Google's market growth and market size in the advertising industry have been substantial. According to eMarketer, in 2020, Google's advertising revenue generated approximately $146.92 billion, capturing a significant share of the global digital ad market. Its dominance can be attributed to its wide range of advertising products, such as Google Ads, Display & Video 360, and AdMob, which target different platforms and audiences.</p><p>Apple, another major player in the cross-platform and mobile advertising market, has a different approach to advertising. Apple's focus is on user privacy and data protection. The company launched its mobile advertising platform, iAd, in 2010. However, it discontinued the platform in 2016 to focus on other core services. Despite this, Apple continues to leverage its ecosystem and data to offer targeted advertising options to app developers through the App Store and Search Ads. With a loyal user base and extensive reach, Apple's advertising revenue remains a significant part of its overall business.</p><p>InMobi, a global mobile advertising and discovery platform, has experienced considerable market growth over the years.

As of 2020, InMobi reported annual revenue of around $1 billion, showcasing its strong position in the market.</p><p>Millennial Media, which was acquired by AOL in 2015, is another significant player in the mobile advertising market. Millennial Media was founded in 2006 and became one of the largest independent mobile ad networks before its acquisition. The company offers advertisers access to a vast mobile audience through its data-driven platform. Its market growth was particularly impressive in the early stages, but it faced increased competition from larger players like Google and Facebook. Details on Millennial Media's specific sales revenue are not available due to its acquisition and integration with AOL.</p><p>In summary, Google's dominance in the advertising market is undeniable, with significant market growth and size. Apple, with its focus on user privacy, continues to generate substantial advertising revenue through its ecosystem. InMobi's global expansion and Millennial Media's acquisition by AOL showcase the dynamic nature of the cross-platform and mobile advertising market. These players, along with others like Microsoft Corporation, Facebook, and SAP SE, continue to shape the industry and compete for a share of the thriving market.</p></p>
