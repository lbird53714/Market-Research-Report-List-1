<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-end ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilation</li><li>Non-invasive Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>High-end ICU ventilators are advanced medical devices used in intensive care units to assist patients with breathing difficulties. The market can be categorized into invasive ventilation and non-invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves the insertion of a tube into the patient's airway, providing mechanical support to its function. Non-invasive ventilation, on the other hand, delivers respiratory assistance through a mask placed on the patient's face, avoiding the need for intubation. Both types aim to improve oxygenation and remove carbon dioxide, ensuring proper respiration in critically ill individuals.</p></p>
