<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Rear Wiper Motors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AC Motors</li><li>DC Motors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive rear wiper motors market includes two main types: AC motors and DC motors. AC motors, or alternating current motors, utilize an electric current that constantly changes direction, providing high torque and efficient energy conversion. On the other hand, DC motors, or direct current motors, use a unidirectional current flow, making them suitable for applications that require precise control and speed regulation. Both AC and DC motors play crucial roles in powering rear wiper systems in vehicles, ensuring effective clearing of the rear windshield for enhanced visibility.</p></p>
