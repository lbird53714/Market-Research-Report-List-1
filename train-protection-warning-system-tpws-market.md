<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Train Protection & Warning System (TPWS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Overspeed Sensor System (OSS)</li><li>Train Stop System (TSS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Train Protection & Warning System (TPWS) is a safety measure implemented in railways to prevent accidents caused by overspeeding or lack of control. It consists of two market types: Overspeed Sensor System (OSS) and Train Stop System (TSS). OSS senses the train's speed and activates appropriate warnings or emergency actions if it exceeds the set limit. TSS, on the other hand, uses track-based sensors to detect the train's position and automatically applies brakes if it approaches a dangerous area. These systems ensure enhanced safety and minimize the risk of accidents in train operations.</p></p>
