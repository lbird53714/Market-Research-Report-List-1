<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Oil Strainer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Floating Type</li><li>Fixed Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Automotive Oil Strainer Market is divided into two main types: Floating Type and Fixed Type. The Floating Type oil strainers are designed to move with the oil level in the engine, ensuring continuous oil supply even during extreme movements. On the other hand, Fixed Type oil strainers are stationary and operate at a fixed position within the engine. While Floating Type provides better oil supply, Fixed Type offers a more stable filtration process. Both types have their advantages and are used depending on the specific requirements of the engine.</p></p>
