<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Phase-Shifting Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Core Type</li><li>Two Core Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Phase-Shifting Transformers (PSTs) are used to control the power flow in electrical networks. The market for PSTs can be categorized into two types: single-core type and two-core type. In single-core type transformers, there is only one magnetic core, which allows for higher voltage and power capacity. Two-core type transformers, on the other hand, consist of two independent magnetic cores that enable the transformer to have multiple output voltages and flexibility in shifting the phase angle. Both types serve the same purpose of regulating power flow but differ in their design and functionality.</p></p>
