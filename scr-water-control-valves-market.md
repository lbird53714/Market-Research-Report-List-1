<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SCR Water Control Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2-Way Type</li><li>3-Way Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>SCR water control valves are available in two types: 2-way and 3-way. </p><p>The 2-way type refers to valves that have two ports - an inlet and an outlet - designed to control the flow of water in a straight line. These valves are commonly used in applications where water flow needs to be opened or shut off completely.</p><p>On the other hand, the 3-way type valves have an additional port that allows water to flow in three different directions. This type of valve is used to control water flow in more complex systems, such as diverting water between multiple outlets or mixing hot and cold water.</p></p>
