<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alumina Ceramic Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Microfiltration</li><li>Ultrafiltration</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The alumina ceramic membrane market consists of two types: microfiltration and ultrafiltration. Microfiltration is a membrane filtration technique that is used to separate suspended particles from a liquid, by passing the liquid through a membrane with tiny pores. It is typically used for clarifying and sterilizing beverages, as well as removing particles from wastewater. Ultrafiltration, on the other hand, is a more advanced technique that helps separate smaller particles and molecules from a liquid. It is commonly used in applications such as protein concentration and fractionation, as well as water purification.</p></p>
