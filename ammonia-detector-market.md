<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ammonia Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Permanent</li><li>Portable</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The ammonia detector market consists of two primary types: permanent and portable detectors. Permanent detectors are installed in fixed locations, typically in industrial settings where ammonia leaks can occur. These detectors continuously monitor the air for ammonia gas and provide real-time alerts if levels exceed a predetermined threshold. Portable detectors, on the other hand, are handheld devices that are easy to carry around. They are mainly used by emergency response teams, workers in confined spaces, or for occasional monitoring tasks outside of fixed locations. Both types of detectors play crucial roles in ensuring the safety of personnel and preventing ammonia-related incidents.</p></p>
