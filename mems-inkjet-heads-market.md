<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MEMS Inkjet Heads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Inkjet</li><li>Random Inkjet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) Inkjet Heads market can be segmented into two types: Continuous Inkjet and Random Inkjet. Continuous Inkjet printers create a continuous stream of tiny droplets, with a portion being deflected and used for printing, while the rest is recirculated. This technology is suitable for high-speed printing and coding applications. Random Inkjet printers, on the other hand, eject droplets randomly onto the substrate without a defined path. This is ideal for graphics printing and decorative applications, as it allows for more flexible and creative designs.</p></p>
