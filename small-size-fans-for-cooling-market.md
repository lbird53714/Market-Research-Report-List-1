<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Size Fans for Cooling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The small size fans for cooling market can be categorized into two types: axial fans and centrifugal fans. Axial fans are designed with blades that generate airflow in a axial direction parallel to the axis of rotation. They are commonly used in applications where a large volume of air needs to be moved at a low pressure. On the other hand, centrifugal fans use impellers to create airflow perpendicular to the axis of rotation. These fans are ideal for applications requiring higher pressures. Both types offer efficient cooling solutions for different needs.</p></p>
