<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Optic Extensometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact-Type Extensometers</li><li>Non Contact-Type Extensometers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Contact-type extensometers are devices used to measure strain or deformation in materials by physically attaching them to the surface of the material. They use direct contact to obtain measurements, providing accurate and reliable results. On the other hand, non-contact type extensometers do not require physical contact with the material and instead rely on optical or laser technology to measure strain or deformation. These extensometers offer advantages such as non-invasive measurement, high precision, and the ability to measure on delicate or inaccessible surfaces. Both types of extensometers have their own applications and advantages based on the specific needs of the user.</p></p>
