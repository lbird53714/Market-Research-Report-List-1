<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Temperature Sensitive Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversible</li><li>Irreversible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The temperature sensitive coating market can be divided into two types: reversible and irreversible. Reversible coatings change color or appearance temporarily when exposed to a specific temperature, but revert back to their original state when the temperature returns to normal. These coatings are often used for indicating temperature variations, such as on thermometers or temperature-sensitive labels. On the other hand, irreversible coatings permanently change their color or appearance when exposed to a certain temperature and do not revert back. These coatings have applications in safety indicators, quality control, or anti-counterfeiting measures.</p></p>
