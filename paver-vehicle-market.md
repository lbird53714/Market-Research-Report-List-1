<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Paver (Vehicle) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Pavers</li><li>Hydrostatic Pavers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pavers in the vehicle market are classified into two main types: mechanical pavers and hydrostatic pavers. Mechanical pavers utilize a mechanical system, such as a conveyor or auger, to distribute and lay asphalt or concrete materials accurately. On the other hand, hydrostatic pavers use a hydraulic system to control the flow and placement of these materials. Both types of pavers play crucial roles in constructing roads, driveways, and other surfaces, ensuring precision and efficiency in the overall paving process.</p></p>
