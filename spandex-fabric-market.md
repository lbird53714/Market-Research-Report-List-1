<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spandex Fabric Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution Dry Spinning</li><li>Solution Wet Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spandex fabric is produced through two main types of processes: solution dry spinning and solution wet spinning. In solution dry spinning, the polymer is dissolved in a solvent, then forced through a spinneret and passed through a warm air chamber, where the solvent evaporates, leaving behind solid spandex fibers. Conversely, in solution wet spinning, the polymer solution is extruded into a coagulating bath instead of an air chamber, resulting in the formation of fibrous spandex. These different methods cater to specific market needs and applications within the spandex fabric industry.</p></p>
