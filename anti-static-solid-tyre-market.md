<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Static Solid Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stick Tire</li><li>Non-stick Tires</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Anti-Static Solid Tyre market encompasses two types of tires: stick tires and non-stick tires. Stick tires have a higher level of friction, which provides better traction and grip on both wet and dry surfaces. This makes them ideal for off-road or uneven terrains, ensuring stability and control. On the other hand, non-stick tires have a lower level of friction, allowing for smoother and more effortless movement. These tires are commonly used in applications that require high speeds and minimal resistance, such as indoor or urban environments.</p></p>
