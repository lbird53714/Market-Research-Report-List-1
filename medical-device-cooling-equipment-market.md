<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Device Cooling Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid-based Cooling System</li><li>Air-based Cooling System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical device cooling equipment market includes two main types: liquid-based cooling systems and air-based cooling systems. Liquid-based cooling systems use fluids to dissipate heat generated by medical devices, such as MRI machines or x-ray equipment. These fluids circulate through a closed loop system, extracting heat and preventing overheating. On the other hand, air-based cooling systems use fans or blowers to cool down the devices by circulating cool air around them. Both types serve the purpose of maintaining optimal operating temperatures and ensuring the efficiency and longevity of medical devices.</p></p>
